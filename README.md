# A Case Study on Verifying Elevator Scheduling Control System in Siemens S7-200 PLC

**Abstract**
This repro contains all of our experiment results from the paper. All SMT formulas are generated by using [Cyclone](https://cyclone.cs.nuim.ie/), a tool for verifying/testing graph-based structures. Note that for buildings that has high levels, please use our [Cyclone VS code plug-in](https://github.com/classicwuhao/CycloneVSCodePlugin).

## Features
- [A full state diagram for scheduling control logic in S7-200 PLC](https://github.com/sandy686-234/Elevator_SMT_Verification/blob/main/docs/state_diagram.png)
- [A complete set of formulas for scheduling control logic in S7-200 PLC](https://github.com/sandy686-234/Elevator_SMT_Verification/blob/main/docs/SMT%20Formulas%20for%20State%20Transitions.pdf).
- [A python program that automatically generate specification for n-floor scheduling control logic](https://github.com/sandy686-234/Elevator_SMT_Verification/blob/main/auto_fsm_generator.py). 
- A fully automatic tool Cyclone generates SMT formulas for verification. Tutorial about how to use Cyclone, please visit [here](https://classicwuhao.github.io/cyclone_tutorial/tutorial-content.html).

## Reproducing Results
**Instructions**:
- Make sure you have Java (x64 is preferred) installed.
- Save the generated code produced from auto_fsm_generator.py into .cyclone file.
- [Install Cyclone for VS Code Plug-in](https://github.com/classicwuhao/CycloneVSCodePlugin), just follow the instructions (very straightforward)
- Launch VS Code, open .cyclone file.
- Right click editor -> choose 'Cyclone' -> choose 'Check This Cyclone Spec'
- Wait till Cyclone finishes verification
- Select 'Show Trace File ' or 'Show Trace File (Graphic)' if you have installed 'graphviz' and make sure you tick 'Generate Graphic Trace' in Cyclone settings.
- This will show you the trace in text or image.
